# Project Pokemon

This is a dynamic web application showcasing a collection of Pokémon, allowing users to search and filter Pokémon by name and type. The project uses the PokéAPI to fetch data for 160 Pokémon and displays it in an interactive interface with a loading screen, search functionality, and type-based filtering.

## Features
- **Loading Screen**: Displays a loading animation until all Pokémon data is fully loaded.
- **Search by Name**: Allows users to search Pokémon by name, with instant results.
- **Filter by Type**: Provides a dropdown menu for users to filter Pokémon by type, such as Grass, Fire, Water, and more.
- **Responsive Cards**: Each Pokémon is shown on a card displaying its name, rank, type, front, and back images.
- **Type-Based Styling**: Cards are color-coded based on Pokémon type for easy identification.

## How It Works
1. **Fetch Data**: On page load, data for 200 Pokémon is fetched from the PokéAPI.
2. **Display Cards**: Pokémon data is organized and displayed on cards in a grid layout.
3. **Search Function**: Typing in the search field filters Pokémon by name.
4. **Filter by Type**: Selecting a type filters Pokémon by the selected type.
5. **Reset Button**: Resets the search and filter to show all Pokémon.
